  "description": "May as well start with letter A. Popular in the 1960s, as the name implies this simple sleeveless dress gets wider towards the hem so that the skirt finishes up broader than the shoulders in an obvious A shape. The simplistic silhouette is an ideal blank canvas for vibrant highly patterned fabrics. Many sixties knee-length dresses can be found with this silhouette.",

  "description": "A classic vintage or retro dress style that has remained popular through most decades from the 1940s onwards.  This flattering dress suits most figure types and is one of my own favourites.  The fit and flare dress usually has a simple bodice with darts from the waist into the bust-line.  The necklines vary - round, square, sweetheart necklines to name a few.  The skirt is flat over the tummy and flares out with extra fabric towards the hem.  If laid flat the skirt would be half-circle, commonly known as a semi-circle skirt or a full-circle skirt.  This style of vintage dress is often associated with 1940's and 1950s dances.  If the skirt extends from a higher than the natural waistline it is usually called a Swing dress. This cut allows lots of movement potential…. the dress will “swing” when you walk or dance!",

  "description": "In creating this image of the night sky—dominated by the bright moon at right and Venus at center left—van Gogh heralded modern painting’s new embrace of mood, expression, symbol, and sentiment. Inspired by the view from his window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy, in southern France, where the artist spent twelve months in 1889–90 seeking reprieve from his mental illnesses, The Starry Night (made in mid-June) is both an exercise in observation and a clear departure from it. The vision took place at night, yet the painting, among hundreds of artworks van Gogh made that year, was created in several sessions during the day, under entirely different atmospheric conditions.

  "description": "Edwardian furniture is often characterized by eclecticism instead of focusing on just one style or design. That&amp;amp;amp;#x27;s because furniture makers during the Edwardian era sought to bring back designs from previous periods while incorporating new elements.During the Edwardian period, the favourite wood used for making furniture was mahogany but with a much lighter aesthetic. Sone light materials like wicker and bamboo were also introduced in making furniture. Also preferred by designers was bird&amp;amp;amp;#x27;s-eye maple, thus creating an easy-to-polish speckled finish.",

  "description": "The Jaguar E-Type, or the Jaguar XK-E for the North American market, is a British sports car that was manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd between 1961 and 1974. Its combination of beauty, high performance, and competitive pricing established the model as an icon of the motoring world. The E-Type's claimed 150 mph (241 km/h) top speed, sub-7-second 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration, unitary construction, disc brakes, rack-and-pinion steering, and independent front and rear suspension distinguished the car and spurred industry-wide changes.[5] The E-Type was based on Jaguar's D-Type racing car, which had won the 24 Hours of Le Mans for three consecutive years beginning in 1955,and employed what was, for the early 1960s, a novel racing design principle, with a front subframe carrying the engine, front suspension and front bodywork bolted directly to the body tub. No ladder frame chassis, as was common at the time, was needed and as such the first cars weighed only 1315 kg (2900 lb).",
